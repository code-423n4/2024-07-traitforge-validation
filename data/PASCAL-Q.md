The protocol operates on a kind of first come first serve basis meaning that the first minters in a generation get to mint with around 0.005 ether while the end minters get to mint for around 0.25 ether which is a significant difference. 
The issue is that there is no incentive for minting late so users are not incentivized to mint late but rather are forced to wait for a new generation, so there should be an incentive countering the higher mint fees they are paying. Hence, there gets to a particular stage in a generation where minting will reduce drastically or stop completely and everyone will be waiting for the next generation (this is even if the first generation will mint out), so the protocol might even shut down as there wonâ€™t be any active mint going on. 
Create an incentive for late minters maybe after 6000 tokens in a generation they should all be forgers or something else entirely
