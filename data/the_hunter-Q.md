### [GAS-1] AVOID RE-STORING VALUES
The function is found to be allowing re-storing the value in the contract's state variable even when the old value is equal to the new value. This practice results in unnecessary gas consumption due to the Gsreset operation (2900 ga s), which could be avoided. If the old value and the new value are the same, not updating the storage would avoid thi s cost and could instead incur a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) or a Gwarmaccess (100 gas), potentially saving gas.

### [GAS-2] CACHE ADDRESS(THIS) WHEN USED MORE THAN ONCE
The repeated usage of `address(this)` within the contract could result in increased gas costs due to multiple exec utions of the same computation, potentially impacting efficiency and overall transaction expenses.

### [GAS-3] CHEAPER CONDITIONAL OPERATORS
During compilation, `x != 0` is cheaper than `x > 0` for unsigned integers in solidity inside conditional statements.
