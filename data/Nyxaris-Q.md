Vulnerability Report: Unrestricted Year Duration Setting
Summary
The EntityForging smart contract contains a function setOneYearInDays that allows the owner to arbitrarily set the duration of a year. This function lacks input validation, potentially allowing the owner to set an incorrect or malicious value for the year duration, which could severely impact the contract's functionality.

Affected Code
```solidity
function setOneYearInDays(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
    oneYearInDays = value;
}
```
Impact
Incorrect Forging Reset Periods: If oneYearInDays is set to a value significantly lower or higher than the actual number of days in a year, it will cause the forging count reset mechanism to behave incorrectly.
Potential for Abuse: A malicious or compromised owner could set this value extremely low (e.g., 1 day), allowing frequent resets of forging counts and potentially enabling excessive forging.
Economic Implications: Incorrect settings could lead to an imbalance in the forging ecosystem, potentially devaluing NFTs or allowing for unfair advantages.


Recommended Fix
```solidity
function setOneYearInDays(uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
    require(value >= 365 && value <= 366, "Invalid year duration");
    oneYearInDays = value;
}
```
