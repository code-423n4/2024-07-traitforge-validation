## 1. Integer Division Precision Loss:

 * If msg.value is less than totalDevWeight, amountPerWeight will be 0, leading to all the funds being sent to the owner in the remaining variable.
This might not be the intended behaviour if you expect amountPerWeight to reflect a portion of the msg.value.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge/blob/main/contracts/DevFund/DevFund.sol#L16-L17

```
receive() external payable {
    if (totalDevWeight > 0) {
 ->      uint256 amountPerWeight = msg.value / totalDevWeight;
  ->    uint256 remaining = msg.value - (amountPerWeight * totalDevWeight);
      totalRewardDebt += amountPerWeight;
 ...     
}
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Potential Loss of Funds:

* Since amountPerWeight is added to totalRewardDebt, if the calculation results in 0, it means no funds are being added to totalRewardDebt, but the entire msg.value will go to the owner. Ensure this is the intended logic.

```
receive() external payable {
    if (totalDevWeight > 0) {
       uint256 amountPerWeight = msg.value / totalDevWeight;
       uint256 remaining = msg.value - (amountPerWeight * totalDevWeight);
  ->     totalRewardDebt += amountPerWeight;
...
 (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{ value: remaining }('');
 ...     
}
```
